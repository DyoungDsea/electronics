FEW OBSERVATION
1. The slideshow is taking a while to load. Please optimize it to load faster. solved


2. There's a huge space between the slideshow holder and other sections leaving huge white background at both up and down. solved


3. The logo is not looking great on mobile. So, I suggest that you add a custom query or use CSS to switch between the full logo or the logo icon on both desktop and mobile view respectively
Or
You can use the logo icon on the header and the full logo on the footer

4. On the Top Categories menu list, The icon of Room decor and Building are not commensurate with the names. solved


5. Immediately after"New Arrival" section, compress "Returns", Secured Payment" and "Customer Support" into one section to make room for other sections.


6. Before "Featured Products" section, add "Testimonials" section with scrolling image of customers who have received their products. Names and Products to be included in the image. solved


7. There is too much space between sections of the site. See how you can knit them together may be the padding is too much. solved


8. Consider reducing the height of each section to accommodate more sections


9. Add 4 more sections "Phones" "Fridges & Refrigerators", " Generators", and "LED &Tvs" because these are the four most prominent products people buy with this scheme.


9. On the"Free shipping &Return" remove "on all order above N100,000 and add "free shipping on all products apart from furniture, Tanks, building materials and other heavy products
